## Instagram Clone!

Here we can see a few features mimicked by Instagram.

### Login Screen

In order to see any posts, you must first pass the login screen. Entering a username and password (Not authenticated at this time) will allow you to view the Posts Page.

### Posts Page

Using Dummy Data, Posts populate from an array.

### Ability to Comment

The comment bar underneath each comment will add your comment to the Array and in turn, add it to the list of comments for each individual post.

### Ability to Like each individual Post

Clicking on the "heart" symbol will not just increase the amount of likes, but toggle in case you want to remove your 'like' from the post.
